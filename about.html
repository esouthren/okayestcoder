                        Hi there!   
                        <br /><br />
                        I'm the Okay-est Coder. Thanks for visiting.
                        <br /><br />
                        I study Computer Science in Scotland. 
                        <br /><br />
                        I'm currently a software engineering intern at Google on the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/">Arts and Culture</a> team.
                        <br /><br />
                        In 2017, I interned for a year at the <a href="https://www.stfc.ac.uk/">Science and Technology Facilities Council</a>, a government-funded research lab in Oxfordshire, England. There, I attempt to talk to physics equipment in Python, C and Java. 
                        <br /><br />
                        This blog is for bits of code I find interesting, Hackathons I go to, interview advice, and anything else I feel inclined to type about.
                        <br /><br />
                        Have a poke around my coding work at my <a href="https://github.com/esouthren/">Github</a> page (why not check out the repository for <a href="https://github.com/esouthren/okayestcoder">this site </a> and see how it's built?).
