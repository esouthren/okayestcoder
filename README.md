# the okay-est coder
My coding/venting blog. Jquery, Firebase backend for post storage.

Live at: (https://esouthren.github.io/okayestcoder/index.html)


Things to Add:

###### Thumbnail reference to storage location put in post database record
    > When post uploads, url reference is created from image
        > (would have to confirm image upload first? so reference can be created?)
        
###### Can add images to post creation and have them automatically update
    > would need an img uploader box
        > possibility to rename images? to force a standard e..g thumbnail_1, thumbnail_2
        
###### improve colour scheme cause whaaaat is going on there

###### take a coding break, write an article or two ;)

###### animated changes when clicking on post? may require larger rewrite of post displaying

###### 'about' page

###### better logo/blurb

###### prism code highlighting for posts
